First ~11 months of sleep and feed log for a newborn.

# Data
Type: CSV
Columns: Date and Time, End Time, Duration (min), Activity, Quantity, Extra data, Text, Notes, Caregiver

# Why?
No reason. We tracked tracked our newborn's feeding and sleep cycles for the first 1yr just to understand her habits. Data of one is not really helpful to draw any scientic conflusions but it might help someone understand what to expect from a new born I have attached from screenshots.

# How can you use it?
You can load the CSV your data analysis tool of choise - NumPy, Google Data Studio, R etc and try to viz her sleeping and feed cycles. Another thing worth trying is predcting the next time she will fall asleep using [Facebook's Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/).
